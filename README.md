# Semester Grade Calculator

This is a simple program to calculate the minimum grade that can be recived on 
finals to recive a desired grade when Quarter 1 and Quater 2 are worth 40% each
and the final is 20%.

**PLEASE DO NOT PUT IN NON-NUMERICAL VALUES INTO THE INPUT**
It will error and will not give you you answer.

The only dependency to run the program is Python3 for the TUI version and
Tkinter for the GUI version

Windows Python has tkinter pre-installed\
If you are using Debian Linux or a variant use the following command to install tkinter
```bash
    suso apt-get install python3-tk
```
If it is not installed on your system a simmlar command should work if on Linux,
but always consult the internet
